Hello to whoever reading this blog.

It's simply describing my journey to be a registered nurse and what transitions I had to go through. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I am a registered nurse, people call me Aashika. Little about myself, Iong story short, I was an international student who joined nursing in Australia and got registration. I always wanted to work in a hospital setting, however when I was looking for a job, I got placed on a waiting list in the hospital due to me not having permanent residency or citizneship here.

Okay, so I started working in one of the telehealth nursing company until I got laid off one day. So my real struggling journey started from there. I started applying for more than 100 plus jobs per day as I was a freshly graduated nurse with experience as a nursing assistant. Trust me, it didn't matter how much I was in the nursing journey, then I realised unless you have equivalent experience, it doesn't matter.

In the process of job hunting, I got an offer from one of the regional places. I took the offer without thinking anything as I was desperate. The place was nearly 9 hours away from a place I was leaving at but I moved there. It was from one of the aged care facilities in a rural place.

I never had any interest in working as an aged care nurse until I got so desperate. When I went to my job on the first day, I had zero knowledge about what I had to do and what the roles of aged care nurses are. There was a myth I used to have that aged care nurses aren't that skilled and all they do is paperwork. I came to know firsthand how hard it truly is to be an aged care nurse.

Looking after 50 residents a day, dealing with families, following up with appointments, constantly being hit by short-staffed while handling all normal work like medications, insulins, s8, attending to wounds, being in charge for the place, and then you are the only person who would be responsible for looking after those who have falls and deterioration, following up with doctors, pharmacist, pathology, radiology, patient transport, and the list goes on. With all this, you had to ensure you make sure everything is done properly with everyone's scope of practice, making sure everyone gets a proper break even if you miss one.

That is when I realized, yes it's lots and lots of paperwork, loads of them. However, I learned time management, how to resolve conflicts, handle things in a professional way, manage everyone and so much more. 

Okay, this much for today. For the rest of the transition to being a successful aged care nurse in a short period of time, check out my next blog. See you there!
